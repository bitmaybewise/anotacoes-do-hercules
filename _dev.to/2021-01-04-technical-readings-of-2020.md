# Technical readings of 2020

The year 2020 was the most prolific year in terms of readings for me. Because of the pandemic and quarantine, I had way more time to read. Most books weren't programming books, but I will leave here the technical ones and my impressions.

## The Go Programming Language

For sure the reference book for the Go programming language. You're going to find everything you need to get started and some more advanced topics such as goroutines and how to do metaprogramming using reflection.
Because Go has evolved a bit since the release of this book, the module's topic is not up-to-date, but still, a great book that I really recommend, especially because of exercises. I think all programming books should follow this and leave the readers with some exercises to get the hands dirty at the end. Programming needs practice, passive reading is not enough when it comes to writing code.

## Learning Javascript Data Structures and Algorithms

Loiane has a damn good didactic!!!

I guess it's the book with the best introduction to algorithms and data structures I ever read, along with the next one I show next. In special, her explanation of graphs and short distance algorithm is super valuable. 

If you never read any book about the topic and want an introductory hands-on book, start with this one and thank me later. ;)

## Grokking Algorithms

Aditya Bhargava is another author with a teacher's mind. Many difficult topics are easily digested throughout the book. I missed exercises, but if you have the discipline you can basically reproduce the explanations using your favorite programming language. 

## The Algorithm Design Manual

Skiena's book is a reference to algorithms and data structures. While I write this post I'm still trying to read this book. I lack the math background to understand the mathematical proofs, which takes me more time to read since I struggle to understand some parts and need to change my focus to learn something aside before progressing. But for me math is also fun, as long it is not too generic and abstract for my taste, so I keep reading it in slow mode, this way I don't lose the motivation. The pseudo C implementation of algorithms is straightforward if you already have a programming background, trying to re-implement them in your favorite language is eye-opening.

## New years reading resolution

I managed to read 26 varied topics books last year (not counting comic books). My biggest record in terms of reading! 

I will keep my expectations under control. While I still want to continue with the reading habits, I'm pretty sure reading this amount of books again probably will not be the case for this year.
